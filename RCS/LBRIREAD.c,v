			  J <- LBRIREAD()

Logarithmic binary rational interval read.

Inputs (from the input stream)
  An open or one-point logarithmic binary rational interval I.
  The external representation of an open interval is
    (<left endpoint>,<right endpoint>)
  Both endpoints are external representations of logarithmic
  binary rational numbers, the left endpoint being strictly
  smaller than the right endpoint.
  The external representation of a one-point interval is
    [<point>]
  where <point> is an external representation of a logarithmic
  binary rational number.

Outputs
  J : The internal representation of I:
      If I is open, J is the list
        (<left endpoint>,<right endpoint>)
      of the internal representations of the endpoints.
      If I is a one-point interval, J is the list
        (<point>,<point>)
      where <point> is the internal representation of the
      point.

Side effect
   The interval J  is read from the input stream.
   Any preceding blanks are skipped.
