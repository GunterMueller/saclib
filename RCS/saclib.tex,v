The \saclib\ system source code and User's Guide are made available free of
charge by the Research Institute for Symbolic Computation on behalf of the
\saclib\ Group.

Persons or institutions receiving it are pledged not to distribute it to
others.  Instead, individuals wishing to acquire the system should obtain it
by ftp directly from RISC-Linz, informing the Institute of the acquisition.
Thereby the \saclib\ Group will know who has the system and be able to
inform all users of any corrections or newer versions.

Users are kindly asked to cite their use of the system in any resulting
publications or in any application packages built upon \saclib.

Neither \saclib\ nor any part thereof may be incorporated in any commercial
software product without the consent of the authors.  Users developing
non-commercial application packages are kindly asked to inform us.

Requests or proposals for changes or additions to the system will
be welcomed and given consideration.

\saclib\ is offered without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied.
However reports of bugs or problems are encouraged.

\begin{abstract}
This paper lists most of the algorithms provided by \saclib\ and shows how
to call them from C. There is also a brief explanation of the inner
workings of the list processing and garbage collection facilities of
\saclib.
