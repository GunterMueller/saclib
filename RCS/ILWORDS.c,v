@Integer leading words.

@Step2 was changed.  In the previous version, if A was conatined in
two words, and m == n in Step2, a reference was made to B[-1], which
caused problems when the garbage in that location was anything other
than zero.

		       ILWORDS(A,m,B,n; a1,a0,b1,b0)

Integer leading words.

Inputs
  A, B: in Z, in array representation, A, B > 0.  If u and v are the
        bit-lengths of A and B, respectively, then u >= 2 * ZETA and
        u - v < ZETA.
  m, n: BETA digits, the word lengths of A and B, respectively.

Outputs
  a1, a0, b1, b0: BETA digits.
                  a1 consists of the leading ZETA bits of A.
                  a0 consists of the next ZETA bits of A after a1.
                  b1 consists of the leading (ZETA - u + v) bits of B.
                  b0 consists of the next ZETA bits of B after b1.
