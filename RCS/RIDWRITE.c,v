                      RIDWRITE(I,n)

Rational interval decimal write. 

Inputs
   I : an open or one-point interval with rational number
       endpoints.  
   n : a non-negative integer.  

Side effects
   if I is an open interval, the endpoints of I are 
   approximated by n-decimal-digit fractions and printed, 
   using RNDDWRITE.  The left endpoint is rounded down,
   the right endpoint up.  If I is a one-point interval,
   its one point is printed using RNDWRITE, which rounds
   it to the nearest n-digit decimal fraction.
